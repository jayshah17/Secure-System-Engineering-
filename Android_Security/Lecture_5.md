Decomiplation: Trying to reach to Source Code From Executable File. 
Here .dex means Dalvik Executable Code Format

> apktool d .\sample.apk -o test

We observe that the testsample directory does not contain the classes.dex and resources.arsc files
previously present in the ZIP file.
We observe that there is a apktool.yml file created in the directory.
We also observe that there is another AndroidManifest.xml in a new directory called original.
We also observe that there is a new directory called smali which was decompiled from the classes.dex file
present in the original APK ZIP archive.

To align infile.apk and save it as outfile.apk: 

> zipalign -p -f -v 4 infile.apk outfile.apk 
To confirm the alignment of existing.apk, use the following command. 

> zipalign -c -v 4 existing.apk 

# Jadx Tool

We can save the decompiled JAVA source code as a Gradle project, as shown in the below screenshots.
