# Lecture 12 Frida Tool for Network Interospection

Frida is a dynamic instrumentation toolkit designed for developers, reverse engineers, and security researchers. It allows you to inject scripts into running processes to inspect and modify their behaviour on the fly.

Use Cases

•	Security Testing: Inspect and modify the behavior of applications to find vulnerabilities and test security mechanisms.
•	Reverse Engineering: Understand how applications work internally by examining and modifying their runtime behavior.
•	Debugging: Debug applications by injecting scripts to track down bugs and performance issues.
•	Bypassing Restrictions: Modify app behavior to bypass certain restrictions or implement additional features.



Frida uses an injector to load a shared library into the target process. This library provides a JavaScript runtime environment where user scripts are executed. The scripts can hook into various functions, manipulate memory, and interact with the app in real-time.
